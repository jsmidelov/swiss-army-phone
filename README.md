# The "Swiss Army Phone" prototype

## Project info
The project is a webpage or site that lets its users, such as parents of tech-savvy children, to get a sense of is an app is a valuable tool in their digital toolbox, or if it's more of a drug-dispenser, on a scale ranking how addicting a certain app is designed to be.

The idea is that it would look at certain properties of the application, such as its business model, and use a super secret magical algorithm to to place it on a graded scale. Each of these grades are named after relative addictiveness, ranging from "Tool" (best) to "Drugs" (worst).

This project uses Lovable for drafting and prototyping features, and coding manually to fine-tune things.

## What technologies are used for this project?
Lovable has a stack it prefers, and I've thus simply followed it, since doing anything else would be asking for swimming against a current.

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
